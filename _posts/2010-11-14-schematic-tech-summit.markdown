I'm pretty luck to work for a company with an office in Costa Rica. And even luckier to have reasons to travel to our office there. I just returned from a quick three day summit in our San Jose office to better get to know the great people there and figure out how we can improve on the already stellar job they do.

The Trip
--------

Traveling to CR can be an all-day affair if you have a layover, so Tuesday was pretty much a wash. Fortunately, Ravi was on my flight so we could commiserate over the terrible food in DFW. We arrived at the hotel just under twelve hours

We met up with JP, [Justin](http://twitter.com/#!/jstander), [Keegan](http://twitter.com/#!/cowboyrobot), and [Michelle](http://twitter.com/#!/mikey_k) in San Jose, just as the rainy season ended (I tend to bring good weather with me where ever I go).

The Costa Rica office is [ridiculous](http://instagr.am/p/OBuI/ "A photo of the common space").

What We Talked About
--------------------

* How we're structured
* How to think about our titles and career paths
* Our values
* Communication
* Keeping each other accountable and on top of things

Moving Forward
--------------

* Pick the best communication tools that we have and move forward with them
* Weekly meetings across NY, LA, and CR tech
* Discipline group meetings
* Reviewing and revamping standards and best practices
* Finding a place to keep track of off-project research and experimentation

Good Times
----------

Thanks to Rene, Yvette, Shubo, Nicole, Rodolfo, Michelle, and everyone else for making this trip a success and really fun.
